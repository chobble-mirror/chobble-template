Join us every Saturday and Sunday from 9am to 3pm for our famous weekend brunch. We've reimagined classic brunch favourites with a plant-based twist, using locally sourced ingredients wherever possible.

Our relaxed atmosphere is perfect for catching up with friends or enjoying a lazy weekend morning with the papers. Bookings recommended for groups of 4 or more.
